<!-- ## Description -->

**Multi-Modality Arena** is an evaluation platform for large multi-modality models. Following [Fastchat](https://chat.lmsys.org/), two anonymous models side-by-side are compared on visual question answering task. We release the  [**Demo**](https://vlarena.opengvlab.com)  and welcome the participation of everyone in this evaluation initiative.

  

## Supported Multi-modality Models

The following models are involving in randomized battles currently,

 - [**KAUST/MiniGPT-4**](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4)
 - [**Salesforce/BLIP2**](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip2)
 - [**DAMO Academy/mPLUG-Owl**](https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-Owl)
 - [**Facebook/OTTER-9B-hf**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/OTTER)
 - [**DeepMind/Flamingo**](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo)

We will try to schedule computing resources to host more multi-modality model sin the arena.

## Installation



## Launch a Demo
  

server_demo run with the following steps:

1. run controller.py

2. run model_worker.py for some models

3. run server_demo.py

## Acknowledgement
The project is built upon [Fastchat](https://chat.lmsys.org/) and open-source multi-modality models.
