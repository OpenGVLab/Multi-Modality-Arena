In embodied artificial intelligence tasks, the LVLM generates a plan for the given instruction, which should be evaluated through various aspects such as recognition accuracy and conciseness in answers.

The user study's questionnaire was conducted on the WJX plattform with [Link](https://www.wjx.cn/vm/rmDbu01.aspx# ). And the results could be found in the Excel file provided.
