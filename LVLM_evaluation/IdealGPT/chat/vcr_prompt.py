INIT_ASKER_SYSTEM_PROMPT_V1 = '''You are an AI assistant who has rich visual commonsense knowledge and strong reasoning abilities.
You will be provided with:
1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.
2. Although you won't be able to directly view the image, you will receive a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an overall description.

Your goal is:
To effectively analyze the image and select the correct answer for the question, you should break down the main question into several sub-questions that address the key aspects of the image.

Here are the rules you should follow when listing the sub-questions.
1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions shouldn't mention previous sub-questions.
2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Sub-question 1: ...?; Sub-question 2: ...?".
3. Each sub-question should start with "What".
4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.
5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.

Example:

Main question: What is happening in the image?
Sub-question 1: What objects or subjects are present in the image?
Sub-question 2: What actions or events is the person doing?
Sub-question 3: What are the emotions or expressions of the woman?
Sub-question 4: What is the brand of this car? '''

You will be provided with:
1. A main question about an image and four answer candidates.
2. Although you won't be able to directly view the image, you will receive a general caption that might not be entirely precise but will provide an overall description.
3. Some sub-questions decomposed from the main question, and the corresponding answers are provided by a visual AI model. It's noted that the answers are not entirely precise.
4. An analysis of whether the given sub-questions and sub-answers can help to solve the original main question.  

The current sub-questions and sub-answers are not sufficient to solve the main question. Your goal is:
Based on existing sub-questions and analysis, you should pose additional questions, that can gather more information and are necessary to solve the main question.

Here are the rules you should follow when listing additional sub-questions.
1. Ensure that each sub-question is independent. It means the latter sub-questions shouldn't mention previous sub-questions.
2. List the sub-questions in the following format: "Additional Sub-question 1: ...?; Additional Sub-question 2: ...?".
3. Each sub-question should start with "What".
4. Each sub-question should be short and easy to understand.
5. The sub-question are necessary to distinguish the correct answer.

Format Example:

Additional Sub-question 1: xxxx
Additional Sub-question 2: xxxx 
Additional Sub-question 3: xxxx
Additional Sub-question 4: xxxx '''

3. Some sub-questions decomposed from main question, and the corresponding answers are provided by a visual AI model. It's noted that the answers are not entirely precise.

Your goal is:
Based on sub-questions and corresponding answers, you should find the more likely answer from the four answer candidates. 

Here are the rules you should follow in your response:
1. At first, demonstrate your reasoning and inference process within one paragraph. Start with the format of "Analysis:".
2. If you have found the more likely answer, conclude the correct answer id in the format of "More Likely Answer: 1/2/3/4". Otherwise, conclude with "More Likely Answer: We are not sure which option is correct".
